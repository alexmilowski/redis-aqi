This is a complete guide to deploying the whole system on Kubernetes. The
data collection, ingest, Redis, and web application can be deployed within
a single namespace. Kubernetes allows for a scale-out deployment of ingest
and the Redis database. The web application can be scaled independently from the
database and ingest workloads.
